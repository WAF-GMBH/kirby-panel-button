# Kirby Panel Button Plugin

<img width="100%" height="auto" alt="Kirby CMS button field to open URLs in a new tab or trigger webhooks" src="screenshot.png" />

Custom Kirby Panel field, that displays a button that can be used to either open a URL in a new tab or to trigger some url or webhook and wait for success or error. This can be very helpful, when you have content that can be viewed or edited on some external service or domain.
